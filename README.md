# End to end sentiment analysis

> In this project I used textblob library in Python and tried to do some analysis on the text provided.
I summerized the text, find out the sentiment and also point out the subjectivity of the text. I implemented a simple UI using HTML,CSS,JavaScript and also Flask as my API handling back end tool.
